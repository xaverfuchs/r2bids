# r2bids - Covert R data to BIDS format

This package provides functions for converting and storing data
reprensented in R data frames in the convenient [BIDS
format](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

The BIDS format is becoming increasingly popular in neuroscience as a
means of storing data sets along with structured descriptions of
samples, tasks, and variables.

## Installation

You can install the development version of *r2bids* from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("xaverfuchs/r2bids")
```

## Example case

``` r
library(r2bids)
```

### Generate some toy data

``` r
example_data <- data.frame(
  ParticipantID = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3),
  Gender=c("M", "F", "O", "M", "F", "O"),
  Age=c(21, 32, 27, 21, 32, 27),
  Session = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2),
  ResponseTime = c(350, 400, 375, 415, 372, 401),
  Accuracy = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
)
```

### Validate the input data

This function does renaming of variables and labels to adhere to BIDS
conventions.

``` r
example_data_checked <- check_input_data(data = example_data, 
                 participant_col = "ParticipantID", 
                 session_col = "Session", 
                 gender_col = "Gender")
#> 
#> Step 1: checking variable labels
#> checking variable Gender
#> renamed variable label: M -> m
#> renamed variable label: F -> f
#> renamed variable label: O -> o
#> 
#> Step 2: checking participant and session identifiers
#> renamed variable: ParticipantID -> participant_id
#> renamed ids to sub-001, sub-002, sub-003 ...
#> renamed variable: Session -> session
#> renamed sessions to ses-01, ses-02 ...
#> renamed variable: Gender -> gender
#> 
#> Step 3: checking if all variable names are snake_case
#> renamed variable: Age -> age
#> renamed variable: ResponseTime -> response_time
#> renamed variable: Accuracy -> accuracy
#> 
#> Step 4: checking correct coding of gender variable
#> Warning in check_input_data(data = example_data, participant_col =
#> "ParticipantID", : Invalid values found in gender column. Please recode to 'm',
#> 'f', or 'o'.
```

### Write BIDS file

``` r
write_bids(data = example_data_checked, output_dir = "./readme_files/example_bids", task_name = "reaction", participant_info_cols = c("age", "gender"), file_suffix = "beh")
#> Main BIDS directory successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids
#> Participants data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/participants.tsv
#> Folder successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-001/ses-01
#> Task data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-001/ses-01/sub-001_task-reaction_beh.tsv
#> Folder successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-001/ses-02
#> Task data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-001/ses-02/sub-001_task-reaction_beh.tsv
#> Folder successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-002/ses-01
#> Task data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-002/ses-01/sub-002_task-reaction_beh.tsv
#> Folder successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-002/ses-02
#> Task data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-002/ses-02/sub-002_task-reaction_beh.tsv
#> Folder successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-003/ses-01
#> Task data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-003/ses-01/sub-003_task-reaction_beh.tsv
#> Folder successfully created: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-003/ses-02
#> Task data saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/sub-003/ses-02/sub-003_task-reaction_beh.tsv
```

### Define Metadata and write JSON file

``` r
# Metadata for the example above with nested lists for each variable
meta_data <- list(
  participant_id = list(
    Description = "Unique participant identifier in the format sub-XXX.",
    Levels = list(
      "sub-001" = "Participant 1",
      "sub-002" = "Participant 2",
      "sub-003" = "Participant 3"
    )
  ),
  gender = list(
    Description = "Self-reported gender of the participant.",
    Levels = list(
      "m" = "Male",
      "f" = "Female",
      "o" = "Other"
    )
  ),
  age = list(
    Description = "Age of the participant in years.",
    Units = "years"
  ),
  session = list(
    Description = "Session identifier.",
    Levels = list(
      "ses-01" = "First session",
      "ses-02" = "Second session"
    )
  ),
  response_time = list(
    Description = "Response time of the participant in the task.",
    Units = "milliseconds"
  ),
  accuracy = list(
    Description = "Task accuracy (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect).",
    Levels = list(
      "0" = "Incorrect response",
      "1" = "Correct response"
    )
  )
)
```

``` r
write_metadata(output_dir = "./readme_files/example_bids", task_name = "reaction", meta_data = meta_data)
#> Metadata JSON saved: ./readme_files/example_bids/task-reaction_beh.json
```

The resulting output looks like that:
